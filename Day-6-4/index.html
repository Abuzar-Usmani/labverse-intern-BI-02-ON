Long Paragraphs #2
Why do Atoms Explode when they are Split?

Atoms of radioactive elements can split. According to Albert Einstein, mass and energy are interchangeable under certain circumstances. When atoms split, the process is called nuclear fission. In this case, a small amount of mass is converted into energy. Thus the energy released cannot do much damage. However, several subatomic particles called neutrons are also emitted during this process. Each neutron will hit a radioactive element releasing more neutrons in the process. This causes a chain reaction and creates a large amount of energy. This energy is converted into heat which expands uncontrollably causing an explosion. Hence, atoms do not literally explode. They generate energy that can cause explosions.

Papermaking

Daily Test - Attempt Now
Everyone knows that paper is made from trees. But when one looks at trees, one cannot imagine that something so soft and fragile as the paper is made is so hard and strong. Plant materials such as wood are made of fibres known as cellulose. It is the primary ingredient in paper making. Raw wood is first converted into pulp consisting of a mixture of Cellulose, lignin, water and some chemicals. The pulp can be made mechanically through grinders or through chemical processes. Short fibres are produced by mechanical grinding. The paper produced in this way is weak and is used to make newspapers, magazines and phonebooks. Through the chemical pulping process, strong paper is produced. Cellulose pulp is sprayed to form mats on moving conveyor screens. These mats are then dried, dyed and cut as required.

Long Paragraphs #6
Teacher of Today

The teacher of today is the salt of the earth. He wants to create a man, not just make money. He is a knowledgeable gentleman. He is an expert in the particular subject he teaches. Though a scholar, he teaches the subject in such a way that all students, brilliant or ordinary, can fully understand him. He doesn’t advertise his knowledge. He cares about his students and offers assistance to them both inside and outside of the classroom. He attends his work regularly.

Anything that seems untidy gets the side eye from him. Being conscious of his social responsibilities, he offers assistance to neighbours in need and spends his free time on social services. But there are very few teachers who consider teaching as a mere profession like any other profession. They do not have the dedication to become great teachers for ages.

Long Paragraphs #7
Dowry System

The Dowry system is bad in society. It has turned the sacred matter of marriage into a business deal. The bride is regarded as a marketable commodity. Bride’s parents are often put under inhumane pressure for a handsome dowry. Sometimes they become destitute to give their daughters in marriage. In many cases, young brides are brutally tortured or pushed to commit suicide.

To eliminate this social evil, a complete change in society’s outlook is necessary. Women should be treated as equal partners to men. Their right to comprehensive education and employment and property can bring the right remedy. Legal prohibition of dowry is not enough. Strict social disapproval of dowry is the only guarantee against this evil. Our youth should come forward to create public awareness against this shameful practice.

Long Paragraphs #8
Technical Education

Training in a specific branch of applied science, such as engineering, agriculture, weaving, spinning, etc., is considered technical education. It contrasts with liberal education which aims to impart general knowledge of arts and sciences. In the modern era, technical education is extremely important. Today, a country’s prosperity is determined by its industrial development. The more advanced the country is in industry, the more prosperous the country is. Technical knowledge is now the backbone of industrial progress, which holds the key to national prosperity.

The need for technical education in India is high. The Central Government has made major efforts to build heavy industry since independence. People trained in technical education are required to run various industrial units. Technical education offers a student good prospects. Today, engineering graduates are more likely to find jobs than science or arts graduates.

Long Paragraphs #9
Child Labour

There are many children in our country who are deprived of education and the normal joyous experiences of childhood. While upper-middle-class boys and girls attend school, they work in tea shops or small factories. They work as servants in middle-class and upper-class households. Parents are very poor, so children are forced to take up all these occupations.

Government should come up with strict laws to solve this problem. Along with the law, the government should introduce some economic reforms which will bring down the poverty line to some extent. Apart from this, to solve this problem, illiteracy needs to be eliminated and the birth rate must be controlled.

Long Paragraphs #10
Mr Bucket was the only person in the family with a job. He worked in a toothpaste factory, where he sat all day long on a bench and screwed the little caps onto the tops of the tubes of toothpaste after the tubes had been filled. But a toothpaste cap-screwer is never paid very much money, and poor Mr Bucket, however hard he worked, and however fast he screwed on the caps, was never able to make enough to buy one-half of the things that so large a family needed. There wasn’t even enough money to buy proper food for them all. The only meals they could afford were bread and margarine for breakfast, boiled potatoes and cabbage for lunch, and cabbage soup for supper. Sundays were a bit better. They all looked forward to Sundays because then, although they had exactly the same, everyone was allowed a second helping.
